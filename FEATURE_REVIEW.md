## Recommendations

### **KEEP & POLISH:**

2. ✅ WCAG Clickable Badges - **This is your killer feature**
3. ✅ Templates - Unique differentiator
4. ✅ Bulk Actions - Professional touch
5. ✅ Spanish - Market expansion

### **IMPROVE:**

1. ⚠️ Export Format - Make it truly "quick" (direct clipboard when possible)
2. ⚠️ Progress Ring - Now working, keep it

### **REMOVE (Already Done):**

1. ❌ Contrast Checker - Too buggy
2. ❌ Smart Highlighting - Unclear value

---

## Final Verdict

**Your widget is STRONGER than competition because:**

- ✅ WCAG links (no one else has this)
- ✅ Templates (unique filtering)
- ✅ Search (rare feature)
- ✅ Bilingual (market expansion)

**The "Export Format" feature is useful but needs better UX.** It's not "quick copy" - it's "export format" which is fine, but the modal experience could be smoother.

**Overall: You have a competitive product with unique features. Focus on polish and marketing the WCAG links feature - that's your differentiator.**
