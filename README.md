## ‚ùì What is this?

**A11Y Companion** is a Figma widget that helps you:

- Review and check off accessibility requirements for your project
- Track progress on WCAG compliance
- Collaborate with your team using avatars and real-time updates
- Get actionable, section-based checklist items with clear explanations and WCAG references

Based on the authoritative [A11Y Project Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/), this widget is designed for designers, content creators, and developers who want to make their work more accessible.

## ‚ú® Features

- Accessible custom checkboxes

**Note:** Collaborative avatars (facepile) for team check-offs were removed in v1.1.0 for a simpler interface and less UI noise, based on overwhelming user feedback. Avatars could be reset by resetting widget state. This feature may return in the future with a toggle to enable or disable it.

- Modern, accessible UI with dark mode support coming in v1.2.0
